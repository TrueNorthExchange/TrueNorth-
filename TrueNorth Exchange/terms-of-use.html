                    <p><b>6. Return and Refund Policy</b><br>Cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets are generally irreversible by nature, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transient. We cannot be responsible for any risks associated with the use of the Website, including, but not limited to, currency risk and market risk. All sales after a https://truenorthexchange.com exchange are final.</p>
                    <p>Unsupported coins, tokens, or protocols stored in our system on unrelated wallets cannot be extracted or returned. https://truenorthexchange.com reserves the right to decide this matter on a case-by-case basis. Any decisions by https://truenorthexchange.com regarding the deposit of such coins or tokens when they are no longer supported are final.</p>
                    <p>https://truenorthexchange.com accepts only one deposit for each transaction ID. If your funds are deposited more than once, you need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be accepted, and your exchange cannot be completed.</p>
                    <p>The client is responsible for maintaining the transaction ID and blockchain transfer hash/TXID, as this is a mandatory requirement when submitting an application. https://truenorthexchange.com is not obliged to respond to requests without a transaction ID and blockchain transfer hash/TXID.</p>
                    <p>The minimum deposit amount depends on the chosen currency. The minimum amount may change over time; you can find the current minimum deposit amount for each currency in the exchange form. Transactions or possible refunds that do not meet the minimum deposit limit will not be processed and will remain in the https://truenorthexchange.com balance until the above requirement is met.</p>
                    <p>The maximum deposit amount depends on the chosen currency. The maximum amount may change over time; you can find the current maximum deposit amount in the currency in the exchange form. Transactions that do not meet the maximum deposit limit may be returned as either the full deposit amount at once or in parts from one maximum deposit amount per day.</p>
                    <p>Deposits credited to our addresses not associated with an active order will be considered as unspecified deposits and will be stored in our systems. Additionally, if any order transaction cannot be completed, the deposited amount remains in our systems. In such cases and all possible situations after which your deposit remains in our systems, https://truenorthexchange.com will attempt to contact you to inform you and return the money. If we do not have contact information, you will have to contact us independently at admin@truenorthexchange.com to request a refund. In the email, you can use the subject “Claim Deposit,” and you will need to provide information such as the blockchain transfer hash/TXID, involved wallet addresses, sent currency, amount, or any other information that may be required to verify ownership of the funds. After you contact us and provide the above, the refund will be made to the original address.</p>
                    <p>Refunds in all cases will be made exclusively to the original address – the address used for the initial transfer of funds to our account. Identification of the original address is carried out by checking the deposit hash/transaction ID using a blockchain explorer. Our team may, at its discretion, confirm the original address with you and, under special circumstances, may issue a refund to an address different from the original. However, this non-standard procedure is subject to review in each specific case and must be approved by senior members of https://truenorthexchange.com for security purposes. Our system is primarily designed to refund to the original address, which is a reliable protective measure aimed at preventing fraudulent attempts by users posing as others. By using our services, you acknowledge your agreement with this policy.</p>
                    <p>If our team correctly processes a refund to the original address, but you find that you cannot access or receive the funds, we advise you to contact your wallet provider. Provide them with the payment hash we provide, and they should assist in resolving the issue. Therefore, we strongly advise you to refrain from deleting or removing addresses used for deposits, as reimbursement for unprocessed orders will be returned to the original address. To ensure the secure receipt of a refund, make sure you use reliable wallet providers capable of crediting the refund amount to your account, otherwise, this may lead to potential loss of funds.</p>
                    <p>https://truenorthexchange.com, including its owner, directors, officers, members, employees, or agents, are not responsible for any inability to access your funds if a refund has been correctly issued to the original address, as evidenced by the relevant blockchain. By using Our services, you guarantee that you agree with our policy of refunding to the original address.</p>

                    <p><b>7. Applicable Expenses</b><br>https://truenorthexchange.com reserves the right to recover reasonable costs for resolving, cash expenses, or time spent on resolving a client’s issue, in the event that a client’s issue related to a transaction or any use of our services did not arise due to a systemic or human error, that is, it was not caused by negligence of our systems or owners, directors, officers, members, or any employees.<br>In any such matter where additional expenses for resolution may apply, you will be notified of the estimated costs for resolution in email correspondence. If such costs cannot be paid via transaction (by collecting an additional fee), you will have to make a separate payment in advance and according to our instructions. If a separate payment for the anticipated applicable expenses for resolving your issue is not received, https://truenorthexchange.com reserves the right to ignore it.</p>

                    <p><b>8. EXCHANGE RATES, FEES, COMMISSIONS AND CONFIRMATIONS</b><br>Please note that the exchange rate displayed during the order creation process is indicative. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies and potential delays in blockchain transaction confirmations, the final rate may differ from the preliminary estimate.</p>
                    <p>The actual exchange rate is determined after the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain network and the funds have been fully credited to the account from which the exchange will be executed.</p>
                    <p>The broadcast of a transaction to the blockchain does not constitute its acceptance by the TrueNorth Exchange service. TrueNorth Exchange does not control the speed of transaction confirmations and cannot influence the time required by the blockchain network or liquidity providers. Users should consider this before proceeding with an exchange.</p>
                    <p>TrueNorth Exchange reserves the right to charge a service fee. The amount of the fee may vary depending on the cryptocurrency, network, liquidity provider, or market conditions. The fee is calculated and deducted from the final amount after the exchange is completed. If third-party service providers are involved, an additional fee may be included in the calculation.</p>

Order Payment Conditions<br>An order is considered paid once:<br>• the deposit has received the required number of confirmations on the network; and<br>• an additional period (up to 4 minutes) has passed to allow full crediting of funds to the service’s or liquidity provider’s balance.<br>8.1.2. Increased Number of Confirmations<br>For TRC20, ERC20, TON, BTC networks, and, in exceptional cases, XMR, funds may initially be credited to the service’s internal node before being forwarded to the exchange.<br>This mechanism is implemented to enhance security and protect users’ funds.<br>In such cases, the required number of confirmations may be increased — typically doubled.<br>You may contact support for the current confirmation requirements.<br>8.1.3. Rate Recalculation<br>If the exchange rate changes by more than 0.005% between the moment the order is created and the moment it begins execution, the system will automatically recalculate the amount based on the real-time market rate at the start of processing.<br>The rate is determined using data from KuCoin and HTX.<br>8.1.4. Liquidity Providers and Technical Delays<br>TrueNorth Exchange relies on external liquidity providers. We do not control their processing speed and are not responsible for potential delays, service outages, or temporary unavailability of specific assets on the provider’s side.<br>Users acknowledge that such circumstances are beyond TrueNorth Exchange’s control.<br>8.1.5. Limit Orders and Alternative Liquidity Sources<br>In the event of insufficient liquidity on the side of our providers, TrueNorth Exchange reserves the right to fully or partially fulfill the order through limit orders in order to secure the most favorable rate for the user.<br>By default, pricing is based on data from KuCoin and HTX. However, in exceptional cases — such as halted trading, asset delisting, technical failures, or withdrawal suspensions from current liquidity providers — TrueNorth Exchange reserves the right to temporarily use alternative exchanges or providers.<br>This is essential to maintain operational stability and ensure service obligations are met.<br>8.1.6. Responsibility for Execution at Market Rate<br>When recalculating an order based on the current market rate, transactions are executed in real time through integrations with liquidity providers.<br>In certain cases, due to high volatility or limited liquidity, the order may be fulfilled using limit orders that may be modified or reissued during the trading process to achieve a better execution price.<br>Such technical adjustments may impact the final amount received by the user, including a possible decrease if the asset’s value declines during execution.<br>These fluctuations reflect real market conditions at the time of exchange and are not subject to compensation by TrueNorth Exchange. The user agrees to these conditions when placing an order.<br>8.1.7. Responsibility for Delays Before or During Order Execution<br>TrueNorth Exchange uses third-party exchanges and liquidity providers to perform exchange operations. In certain cases, order execution may be delayed or suspended due to reasons beyond TrueNorth Exchange’s control (including, but not limited to: AML trigger activations, temporary suspension of trading or withdrawals for specific assets, provider-side technical issues, order book restrictions, and other external circumstances).<br>In such cases, the asset may remain in its original currency until the issues are resolved. During this period, the value of the digital asset may fluctuate in either direction.<br>TrueNorth Exchange bears no responsibility for such fluctuations and will not reimburse losses resulting from asset price changes at the time of final order execution or refund.<br>If the User wishes to preserve asset value by exchanging it into another currency during a delay, they must independently submit a request to TrueNorth Exchange support.The service will assess the feasibility of such an exchange, but does not guarantee technical or regulatory viability.<br>TrueNorth Exchange is not obligated to monitor the market for each individual order, analyze risk profiles, or provide personalized recommendations or alerts regarding potential asset depreciation.<br>The responsibility for monitoring the situation and initiating alternative storage or exchange strategies lies entirely with the User.<br>If the User fails to initiate a request to convert or store the asset in another currency during the review period, and the original asset subsequently loses value, TrueNorth Exchange will not be held liable for any losses, as all applicable processing conditions were fulfilled by the service.<br>Applicable Law and Disputes<br>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Seychelles and any applicable laws thereto.<br>By using our Services, You expressly agree and irrevocably consent that any claim, action, or legal proceeding arising from the Terms or your use of our Service, which may be initiated by You, will be transferred to the Seychelles court.<br>TrueNorth Exchange and you agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of our Service, except for disputes arising from violations of registered or unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade names, logos, or patents.<br>TrueNorth Exchange and You agree to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of its occurrence.
